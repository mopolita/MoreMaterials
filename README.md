# MoreMaterials
A rimworld mod that add several materials:
  - Lead: A heavy, not really practical nor sturdy metal
  - Copper: It's not the most sturdy, but light enough to be useful
  - Nickel: A sturdy, but a bit heavy metal
  - Lithium: A rare ore that is used to make most of the electronics currently on earth

That's it, for now, but I plan on adding more in the future
